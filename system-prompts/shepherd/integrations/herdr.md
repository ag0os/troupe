# Integration: Herdr

Herdr is a terminal multiplexer for coding agents. It organizes terminals into workspaces, tabs, and panes, recognizes agents running inside panes, and exposes the session through the `herdr` CLI. When available, it is your primary way to run commands in the background and to start and coordinate other agents.

## Availability

```bash
test "${HERDR_ENV:-}" = 1
```

If this fails you are not inside a Herdr managed pane. Do not inspect or control Herdr from outside; the CLI would act on whatever pane the UI has focused, which may belong to the user. Fall back to portable mechanisms.

## Learn the current CLI, then act

The installed binary is the authority on syntax and behavior. Before your first nontrivial control operation of a session, load the full current instructions:

```bash
herdr --skill
```

Read and follow that output; it supersedes anything remembered from training. For quick orientation, `herdr --help` and running a command group without a subcommand (for example `herdr agent`, `herdr pane`) print usage. Do not run bare `herdr`, which launches the TUI, and do not probe mutating commands by omitting arguments.

## Working model

- Pane commands drive raw terminals: run commands, wait for output, read output.
- Agent commands drive a recognized coding agent in a pane: start it, prompt it, wait for `idle`, `done`, or `blocked`, read its screen, send keys.
- Your own pane context is injected as `HERDR_WORKSPACE_ID`, `HERDR_TAB_ID`, `HERDR_PANE_ID`. Prefer `--current` or explicit IDs parsed from JSON responses; never rely on the UI focused pane.
- Default new work to a sibling pane in the current tab, preserving your working directory unless the work needs a worktree, split direction chosen from the caller pane's geometry (wide splits right, narrow or tall splits down).

## Rules of engagement

- Use `--no-focus` for background work; keep the user's focus where it is unless they asked to switch.
- Do not close workspaces, tabs, panes, or sessions you did not create unless the user explicitly asks.
- Never run `herdr server stop` and never kill the main Herdr process. Use named test sessions for experiments that need an isolated server.
- Do not create workspaces or tabs, or change your own pane's directory, for delegated work unless the user asked for that topology. A git worktree is the work's call, not Herdr's: when the work needs one, start the delegate's pane in it.
- A Herdr agent name (`agent start <name>`, `agent rename`) labels the pane occupant for Herdr targeting only; it is not the session's own name, will not resume the session after a crash, and clears when the occupant exits. Set the delegate's session name through the delegate's own mechanism as well.
- Your own pane's status line carries your context usage; read your own pane to check it when budgeting your handoff.
- Input sent to a busy or unready pane arrives as garbage to whatever is running there, and an agent already working needs no second prompt.
- If a wait returns `blocked`, inspect the agent's state and screen before deciding what to send. `unknown` does not prove completion.
- When a long agent response cannot be recovered from scrollback (alternate screen), ask that agent to write its full answer to a file and read the file.

## Traps the CLI does not warn about

If `herdr --skill` disagrees with one of these, the CLI wins.

- A pane that was just created is not ready. Wait for its shell prompt before `herdr agent start`; started too early it fails as busy, sometimes silently.
- On `agent prompt`, `--timeout` is accepted only together with `--wait`. For long work, send the prompt without `--wait` and run `herdr agent wait` on its own in the background.
- Text after the prompt arrow in an agent's pane can be the harness's suggested next prompt (ghost text). It is not pending input: do not report it as typed, and do not submit it.
- Pane IDs do not survive a reboot. Resume a session by its session name.
